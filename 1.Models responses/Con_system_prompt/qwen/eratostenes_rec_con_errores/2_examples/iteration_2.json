{ code_sintax_error: "Yes", code_sintax_explanation: "There is a syntax error in the line 'if p is None:' due to incorrect usage of 'p'. It should be 'primes' instead of 'p'. Also, in the line 'p = [i for i in range[2, x + 1]]', 'range' should be called with parentheses: 'range(2, x + 1)'. The same issue occurs in 'for j in range [c*c, x+1, c]': it should be 'for j in range(c*c, x+1, c)'. " }
