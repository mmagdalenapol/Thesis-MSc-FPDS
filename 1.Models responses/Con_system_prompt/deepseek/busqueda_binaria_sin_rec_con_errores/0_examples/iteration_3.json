    "code_sintax_explanation": "The code has several syntax errors. The first one is in the function definition. In Python, the function definition should be 'def fun_1(l, t):'. The second one is in the variable declaration. In Python, the variable declaration should be 'x, y = 0, len(l) - 1'. The third one is in the while loop. In Python, the while loop should be 'while x <= y:'. The fourth one is in the if statement. In Python, the if statement should be 'if l[D] == t:'. The fifth one is in the elif statement. In Python, the elif statement should be 'elif l[D] < t:'. The sixth one is in the else statement. In Python, the else statement should be 'else:'. The seventh one is in the return statement. In Python, the return statement should be 'return -1'."
