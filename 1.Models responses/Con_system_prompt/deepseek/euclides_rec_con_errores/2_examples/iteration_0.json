"code_sintax_explanation": "The code has several syntax errors. The first one is in the comment line. In Python, comments start with '#' and not with '&'. The second one is in the comparison in the if statement. The correct comparison operator is '==' not '='. The third one is in the function call. The function 'euclidean_gcd' is not defined. The fourth one is in the assignment of the variables. The correct syntax is 'variable = value' not 'variable == value'. The fifth one is in the print statement. The correct syntax is 'print(...)' not 'print ...'. The sixth one is in the assignment of the variables. The correct syntax is 'variable = value' not 'variable == value'."
