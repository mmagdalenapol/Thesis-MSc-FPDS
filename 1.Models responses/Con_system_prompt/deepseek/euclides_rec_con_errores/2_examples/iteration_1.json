"code_sintax_explanation": "The code has several syntax errors. The first one is in the comment line. In Python, comments start with a '#' symbol, not with a '&'. The second one is in the if statement where you are trying to assign values to a and b. The correct syntax is 'a, b = b, a'. The third one is in the return statement of the function. The correct syntax is 'return fun_1(b, r)'. The last one is in the example usage. The correct syntax is 'a = 10' and 'b = 6'. The function 'euclidean_gcd' is not defined in the code."
