    "code_sintax_explanation": "In the 'if' structure inside the loop, there is a logical error that could be mistaken for a syntax issue. 'y = c' attempts to assign to 'y' the result of 'c = x // y' which modifies the logic not the syntax directly. However, the error comes from the previous line, where how 'c' and 'r' are calculated and used could cause infinite loops or logic failures, but not directly syntax errors. Therefore, no direct syntax errors are present, the code is syntactically correct but might have logical errors."
