    "code_sintax_explanation": "1. Case sensitivity error: Python is case sensitive and the variable 'Wt' used in the code should be 'wt' as originally defined in the function parameters. There are multiple instances of this error. 2. Incorrect arguments order: In the recursive call 'fun_1(W - Wt[n - 1], wt, n - 1, val)', the order of arguments 'wt' and 'val' are incorrect, it should be 'wt, val' as defined in the function declaration. 3. Incorrect argument in recursive call: In 'fun_1(W, Wt, - 1, val)', the second argument should be 'wt', and the third argument, '- 1' appears to be incorrectly placed and potentially incorrect as '-1' typically is not used as a standalone argument in such context."
