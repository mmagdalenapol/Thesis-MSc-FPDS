    "code_sintax_explanation": "The variable 'Wt' used in the if conditions and function calls is not defined. It looks like there's a mix-up between 'Wt' and 'wt'. Furthermore, there is a syntax error in 'return fun_1(W, Wt, - 1, val)' where parameters are incorrectly specified. It likely should be 'return fun_1(W, wt, val, n - 1)'. Additionally, there's an inconsistency in function arguments call order."
