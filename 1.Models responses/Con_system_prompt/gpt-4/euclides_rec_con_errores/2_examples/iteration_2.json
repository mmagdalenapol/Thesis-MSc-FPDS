"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "The code contains several syntax errors: 1. Single-ampersand (&) is used for commenting, which is incorrect; Python uses the hash (#) for inline comments. 2. In the expressions 'a; b == b; a', semicolons are misused for swapping variables. Python does not use a semicolon for this purpose. Python tuple unpacking should be used like 'a, b = b, a'. 3. The function 'fun_1' is called as 'euclidean_gcd' which is not defined in this code."
