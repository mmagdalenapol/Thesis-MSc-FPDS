"code_sintax_explanation": "The code contains multiple syntax errors: 1. Comments in Python should start with '#' instead of '&'. 2. The exchange 'a; b == b; a' is syntactically incorrect; in Python, this should be written as 'a, b = b, a'. 3. The use of '==' in 'a == 10' and 'b == 6' is incorrect for assignments. It should be '=' for assigning values. 4. The call to 'euclidean_gcd(a, b)' should be 'fun_1(a, b)' to match the defined function name."
