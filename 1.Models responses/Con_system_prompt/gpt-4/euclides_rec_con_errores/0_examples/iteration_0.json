    "code_sintax_explanation": "1. Comments in Python should start with #, but & is used instead.\n2. Multiple statements on a single line should be separated by semicolons correctly; the line 'a; b == b; a' is incorrect and likely intended to be 'a, b = b, a'.\n3. The variables in the example usage (a, b) are compared using '==' (equality) instead of ' = ' (assignment).\n4. The function 'euclidean_gcd(a, b)' is called, but this function is not defined or incorrectly referenced; it should be 'fun_1(a, b)'."
