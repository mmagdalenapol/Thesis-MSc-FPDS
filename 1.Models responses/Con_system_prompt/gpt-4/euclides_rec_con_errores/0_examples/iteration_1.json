    "code_sintax_explanation": "Several syntax errors are present in the provided Python code: 
    1. Comment symbol is incorrect: Python uses '#' for comments instead of '&'. All instances of '&' used for comments need to be replaced with '#'.
    2. Incorrect variable assignment and comparison syntax: 'a; b == b; a' attempts to swap variables incorrectly and misuses the equality operator '=='. It should be 'a, b = b, a' to correctly swap the values.
    3. Undefined function name in print statement: The function 'euclidean_gcd(a, b)' is called, but the defined function is 'fun_1'. It should be 'fun_1(a, b)'."
