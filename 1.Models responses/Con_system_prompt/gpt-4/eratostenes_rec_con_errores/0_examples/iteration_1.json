    "code_sintax_explanation": "There are multiple syntax errors in the provided Python code: 1. The variable 'p' is used but not defined before its use in 'if p is None'. It should be 'primes' based on the function definition. 2. 'range' should be used with parentheses, not square brackets as in 'range[2, x + 1]'. It should be 'range(2, x + 1)'. 3. Incorrect variable 'c' is used; it should be 'current' as per the function signature. 4. The loop uses 'range' incorrectly again with square brackets; it should be 'range(c*c, x+1, c)'."
