"code_sintax_explanation": "1. Function definition fun_1 has a colon missing after its parameters. 2. Variables x and y should be initialized in separate lines or separated by a comma instead of a semicolon. 3. The while loop and conditional statements (if, elif, else) are missing colons at the end. 4. Variable 'd' is not defined; it seems there is a typo in variable names inside the loop."
