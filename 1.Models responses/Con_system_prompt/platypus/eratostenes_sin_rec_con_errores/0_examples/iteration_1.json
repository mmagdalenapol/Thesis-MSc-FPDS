    "code_sintax_explanation": "There are two syntax errors in the code:

1. In the line `p.append{i}`, the syntax for appending an element to a list is incorrect. The correct syntax is `p.append(i)`.
2. In the line `s[0] = s[1] = False`, the assignment operator `=` is used twice in the same statement, which is not allowed in Python. You can fix this by separating the assignments into two lines: `s[0] = False` and `s[1] = False`."
