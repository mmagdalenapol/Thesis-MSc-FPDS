    code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. First, the variable 'p' is not defined before it is used in the if statement. Second, the range function requires two arguments, but three are provided in the for loop. Third, the variable 'c' is not defined before it is used in the for loop. Finally, the function 'fun_1' is not properly indented, making it difficult to determine its scope."
