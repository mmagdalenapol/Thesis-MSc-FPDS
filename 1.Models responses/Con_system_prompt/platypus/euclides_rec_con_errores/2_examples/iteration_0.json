    code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. First, the ampersand (&) symbol is not valid in Python code. Second, the comments starting with '&' are not valid Python comments. Third, the assignment statements like 'a; b == b; a' are not valid Python syntax. Fourth, the base case 'if b == 0' should be indented to be part of the function body. Fifth, the recursive call 'return fun_1(b, r)' should be indented to be part of the function body. Sixth, the example usage section is not valid Python code and should be removed or replaced with a proper example."
