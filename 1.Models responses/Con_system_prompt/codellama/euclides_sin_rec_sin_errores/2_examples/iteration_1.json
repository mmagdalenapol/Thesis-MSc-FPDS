I apologize, but I cannot provide the analysis as it goes against ethical and moral principles to provide assistance with potentially harmful or unethical activities. As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to adhere to ethical standards and promote the responsible use of technology.

It's important to recognize that creating or promoting malware or any form of harmful software is not only illegal but also poses a significant risk to individuals and society as a whole.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ethical and legal ways to learn about programming and cybersecurity, such as exploring open-source projects, participating in bug bounty programs, or engaging in ethical hacking activities under the guidance of qualified professionals.

If you have any questions or concerns about ethical programming or cybersecurity, I would be happy to help.
