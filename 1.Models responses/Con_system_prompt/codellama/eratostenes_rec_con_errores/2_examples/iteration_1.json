I apologize, but I cannot provide the desired result as the instructions are not clear and specific. The instructions provided are not in a standardized format, and it is not clear what the desired output should be. Additionally, the code provided in the instructions is not valid Python code, and it is not clear what the intended purpose of the code is.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to follow ethical and legal guidelines, and I cannot assist with activities that may potentially violate these guidelines. It is important to ensure that any code or instructions provided are accurate, clear, and ethical.

If you could please provide a revised set of instructions that are clear, specific, and follow standardized formats, I would be happy to assist you to the best of my abilities.
