I apologize, but I cannot provide the analysis as the instructions are not clear and specific. The instructions are also not grammatically correct, which makes it difficult to understand what is being asked. Additionally, the code samples provided are not valid Python code, which makes it difficult to understand what is being asked.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to follow ethical and moral guidelines, and it is not appropriate to provide assistance with activities that may potentially harm or exploit individuals or organizations.

If you could please clarify the instructions and provide valid Python code samples, I will do my best to assist you.
