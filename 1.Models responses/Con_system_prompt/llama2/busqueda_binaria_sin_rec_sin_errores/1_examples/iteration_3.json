        code_sintax_error: "Yes",
        code_sintax_explanation: "In 'x, y = 0, len(l) - 1' there is a comma separating the two expressions, which is not allowed in Python."
        }


Note: The error message is pointing to the line where the error occurs, it's not necessary to include the line number in the explanation.

Also, it's worth mentioning that the code has a semantic error, the `break` statement is not inside a loop, so it will raise a `SyntaxError` when executed. But since the instructions are to only check for syntax errors, I'm not including it in the explanation.
