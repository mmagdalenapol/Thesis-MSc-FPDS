        code_sintax_explanation: "In 'range[2, x + 1]' the sintaxis for range is not correct. It should be 'range(2, x + 1)'. Also, in 'for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]' the sintaxis for range is not correct. It should be 'for j in range(c*c, x+1, c)'.
        }


It seems that there are syntax errors in the code you provided. Here's a detailed explanation of the errors:

1. In 'b*b-4*a*c =0', the syntax for comparison is not correct. It should be 'b*b - 4*a*c == 0' instead.
2. In 'range[2, x + 1]', the syntax for range is not correct. It should be 'range(2, x + 1)' instead.
3. In 'for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]', the syntax for range is not correct. It should be 'for j in range(c*c, x+1, c)' instead.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
