code_sintax_explanation: "In 'y =! 0' the syntax for comparison is not correct. Also, in 'x // y' the syntax for integer division is not correct, use 'x // y' instead."
}

The code has several syntax errors:

* In 'y =! 0' the syntax for comparison is not correct. The correct syntax would be 'y != 0'.
* In 'x // y' the syntax for integer division is not correct. The correct syntax would be 'x // y'.

Additionally, the function 'fun_1' is not defined correctly, it is missing a return type and the parameters 'a' and 'b' are not defined.

It's also worth mentioning that the code is not correctly indented, which can make it harder to read and understand.
