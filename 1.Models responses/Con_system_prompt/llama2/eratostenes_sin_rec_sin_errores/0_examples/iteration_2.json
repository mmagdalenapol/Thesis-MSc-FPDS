"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, the `for` loop in the third line has an incorrect indentation. It should be indented more than the `if` statement. Secondly, the `for` loop in the sixth line has an incorrect indentation. It should be indented more than the `if` statement. Thirdly, the `range` function in the eighth line has an incorrect argument. It should be `range(i*i, x+1, i)` instead of `range(i*i, x+1, i)`. Lastly, the `return` statement in the last line is not indented."
