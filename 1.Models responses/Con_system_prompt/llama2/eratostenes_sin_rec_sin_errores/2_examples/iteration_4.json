code_sintax_explanation: "In 'for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):' the syntax for the range function is incorrect. The second argument should be a integer, not a calculation."
}

The code has a syntax error in the range function, the second argument should be a integer, not a calculation.

The function int(x**0.5) + 1 is not a integer, it's a float, so the range function will not work correctly.

Also, the indentation of the code is incorrect, the for loops and the return statement should be indented.
