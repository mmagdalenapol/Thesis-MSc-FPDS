code_sintax_explanation: "In 'if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int) or a <= 0 or b <= 0', there is a missing ')' before the 'or' clause. Additionally, in 'x = max(a, b)', the function max should be capitalized. Finally, in 'r = x % y', the operator % should be surrounded by parentheses."
