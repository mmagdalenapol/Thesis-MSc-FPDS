code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. 
1. The function definition 'def fun_1(l, t)' is missing a colon at the end. 
2. The assignment 'x; y = 0; len(l) - 1' is not valid. It seems like you want to assign 0 to x and len(l) - 1 to y, but the syntax is incorrect. 
3. The while loop condition 'while x <= y' is correct, but the indentation is not consistent. 
4. The variable 'd' is not defined, it seems like you want to use 'D' instead. 
5. The if-elif-else statements are missing colons at the end of each condition."
