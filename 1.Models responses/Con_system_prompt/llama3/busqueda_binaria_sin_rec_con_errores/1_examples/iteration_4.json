code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. 
1. The function definition 'def fun_1(l, t)' is missing a colon at the end. 
2. The assignment 'x; y = 0; len(l) - 1' is not valid, it should be two separate assignments. 
3. The variable 'd' is not defined, it should be 'D'. 
4. The conditions in the if-elif-else statements are missing colons at the end. 
5. The indentation is not consistent, it should be 4 spaces for each level."
