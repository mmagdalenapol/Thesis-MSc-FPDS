RESULT: {"code_sintax_error": "Yes", "code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. 1) The function definition is missing a colon at the end. It should be 'def fun_1(l, t):' instead of 'def fun_1(l, t)'. 2) The assignment 'x; y = 0; len(l) - 1' is not valid. It seems like you want to assign 0 to x and len(l) - 1 to y, but the syntax is incorrect. It should be 'x = 0; y = len(l) - 1'. 3) The variable 'd' is not defined. It seems like you want to use 'D' instead of 'd'. 4) The 'elif' and 'else' statements are missing a colon at the end. They should be 'elif l[D] < t:' and 'else:' respectively."}
