code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors. The function definition 'def fun_1(l, t)' is missing a colon at the end. The variables 'x' and 'y' are not correctly assigned, it should be 'x, y = 0, len(l) - 1'. The 'if' and 'elif' statements are missing a colon at the end. The variable 'd' is not defined, it should be 'D'."
