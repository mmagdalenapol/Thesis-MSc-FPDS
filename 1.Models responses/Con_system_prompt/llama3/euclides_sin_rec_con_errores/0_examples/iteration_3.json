RESULT: {"code_sintax_error": "Yes", "code_sintax_explanation": "There are two syntax errors in the code. The first error is in the line 'while y =! 0:' where the operator '=! ' is not a valid Python operator. It should be '!=' for not equal. The second error is in the line 'return "No se encontró."' where the function is supposed to return a value, but the string 'No se encontró.' does not make sense in this context. It seems like the function is supposed to return the greatest common divisor of two numbers, so it should return a number, not a string. Also, the variable 'ent' is not defined, it should be 'int'."}
