code_sintax_explanation: "There are multiple syntax errors. 1) In 'if p is None:' the variable 'p' is not defined, it should be 'primes'. 2) In 'p = [i for i in range[2, x + 1]]' the syntax for range is incorrect, it should be 'range(2, x + 1)' instead of 'range[2, x + 1]'. 3) In 'for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]:' the syntax for range is incorrect, it should be 'range(c*c, x + 1, c)' instead of 'range [c*c,  x+1, c]'. 4) The variable 'c' is not defined."
