code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors: 1) 'range[2, x + 1]' should be 'range(2, x + 1)' to create a range object. 2) 'p is None' should be 'primes is None' because 'p' is not defined. 3) 'c' is not defined. It should be 'current' or it should be defined before using it. 4) 'for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]' should be 'for j in range(c*c, x+1, c)' to create a range object."
