{"code_sintax_error": "Yes", "code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. 

1. The code uses '&' instead of '#' for comments. 

2. The line 'a; b == b; a' is not a valid Python statement. It seems like the intention was to swap the values of 'a' and 'b', but the correct way to do this in Python is 'a, b = b, a'.

3. The line 'if b = 0:' is using a single '=' for assignment instead of '==' for comparison.

4. The function is defined as 'fun_1' but it is called as 'euclidean_gcd' in the example usage.

5. The variables 'a' and 'b' are assigned values using '==' instead of '='.

6. The function does not handle the case when 'a' or 'b' are not natural numbers, it only raises an error if they are negative, but it does not check if they are integers."}
