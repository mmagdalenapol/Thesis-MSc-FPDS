{"code_sintax_error": "Yes", "code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. 

1. The code uses '&' instead of '#' for comments. 

2. The line 'a; b == b; a' is not a valid Python statement. It seems like the intention was to swap the values of 'a' and 'b', but the correct way to do this in Python is 'a, b = b, a'.

3. The line 'if b = 0:' is using a single '=' for assignment instead of '==' for comparison.

4. The function is defined as 'fun_1' but it is called as 'euclidean_gcd' in the example usage.

5. The variables 'a' and 'b' are assigned values using '==' which is a comparison operator, not an assignment operator. The correct way to assign values is using '='.

6. The function 'fun_1' is not indented properly. In Python, indentation is used to define the scope of a block of code.

7. The 'raise ValueError' statement is not indented properly. It should be indented under the 'if' statement.

8. The 'return a' statement is not indented properly. It should be indented under the 'if' statement."}
