code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors. The & symbol is not a valid syntax in Python, it seems like you are trying to use it for comments, but in Python comments start with #. Additionally, in the line 'a; b == b; a' you are trying to swap the values of a and b, but the correct syntax is 'a, b = b, a'. Also, in the line 'a == 10' and 'b == 6' you are using the comparison operator == instead of the assignment operator =. Finally, you are calling the function euclidean_gcd but it is not defined, you probably meant to call fun_1."
