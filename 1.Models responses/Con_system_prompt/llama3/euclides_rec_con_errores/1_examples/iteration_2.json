code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors: 
1. The syntax for comments in Python is '#' not '&'. 
2. The syntax for assignment is '=' not '==' (in 'a; b == b; a' and 'a == 10', 'b == 6'). 
3. The function name in the function definition is 'fun_1' but it's called as 'euclidean_gcd' in the example usage."
