  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds all prime numbers up to a given number"

The code you provided is a Python function named `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `primes`, and `current`. The function is designed to find all prime numbers up to a given number `x`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function starts by checking if the `primes` argument is None. If it is, the function initializes a list of prime numbers from 2 to `x` using a list comprehension.
2. The function then checks if the square of the current number `c` is greater than `x`. If it is, the function returns the list of prime numbers.
3. If the square of `c` is not greater than `x`, the function iterates over a range of numbers from `c*c` to `x+1` in steps of `c`. For each number `j` in this range, the function checks if it is in the list of prime numbers `p`. If it is, the function removes it from the list.
4. Finally, the function calls itself recursively with the updated list of prime numbers and the next number `c+1` as the new current number.

Overall, the code is written in Python and aims to find all prime numbers up to a given number using a recursive approach.
