  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the prime numbers up to a given number"

The code you provided is a Python function named `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `primes`, and `current`. The function is designed to find the prime numbers up to a given number `x`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line `p = [i for i in range[2, x + 1]]` creates a list of numbers from 2 to `x + 1`.
2. The second line `if c * c > x: return p` checks if the square of the current number `c` is greater than `x`. If it is, the function returns the list of prime numbers up to `c`.
3. The third line `for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]:` loops through the numbers from `c * c` to `x + 1` in increments of `c`.
4. The fourth line `if j in p: p.remove(j)` removes any number that is divisible by `c` from the list `p`.
5. The fifth line `return fun_1(x, c + 1, p)` recursively calls the function with the updated list `p` and the new current number `c + 1`.

The function returns the list of prime numbers up to `x` when the function is called with the arguments `x`, `primes`, and `current`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
