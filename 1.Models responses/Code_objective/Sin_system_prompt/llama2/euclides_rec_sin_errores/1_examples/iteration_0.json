        }

The code provided is a Python function named `euclidean_gcd` that takes two natural number arguments, `a` and `b`. The function implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.

The function first checks if the inputs are natural numbers and ensures that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It then finds the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and makes a recursive call with `a` set to `b` and `b` set to the remainder.

The base case of the recursion is when `b` is 0, in which case the GCD is simply `a`. Otherwise, the function returns the result of the recursive call.

The code also includes an example usage of the function, which prints the GCD of 10 and 6 as 2.
