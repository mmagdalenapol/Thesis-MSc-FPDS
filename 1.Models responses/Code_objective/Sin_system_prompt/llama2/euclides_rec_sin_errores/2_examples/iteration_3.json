  {
        code_language: "python",
        code_objective: "define a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers using the Euclidean algorithm",
        }
    }

Explanation:

* code_language: The programming language used in the code snippet is Python, so the value of this key is "python".
* code_objective: The objective of the code snippet is to define a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, so the value of this key is "define a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers using the Euclidean algorithm".

Note: The code snippet does not contain any syntax errors, but it is not clear what the function `euclidean_gcd` does, as it is not explicitly stated in the code. Therefore, the value of `code_objective` is a concise description of the function's purpose, based on the code's syntax and structure.
