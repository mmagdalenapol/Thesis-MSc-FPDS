  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the first integer greater than 2 that is not a sum of two squares"

Here's the code with some minor formatting changes:
```
def fun_1(x, p=None, c=2):
    if p is None:
        p = [i for i in range(2, x + 1)]
    if c * c > x:
        return p
    for j in range(c * c, x + 1, c):
        if j in p:
            p.remove(j)
    return fun_1(x, p, c + 1)
```
This code defines a function `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`. The function seems to be trying to find the first integer greater than 2 that is not a sum of two squares.

The code first initializes a list `p` of integers from 2 to `x` (inclusive). Then, it checks if `c * c` is greater than `x`. If it is, the function returns `p`. Otherwise, it iterates over the range of integers from `c * c` to `x` (inclusive), and for each integer `j` in that range, it checks if `j` is in `p`. If it is, it removes `j` from `p`. Finally, the function calls itself recursively with `x`, `p`, and `c + 1` as arguments.

It's not immediately clear what the code is doing, but it seems to be trying to find the first integer greater than 2 that is not a sum of two squares. The function is using a recursive approach to find such an integer.
