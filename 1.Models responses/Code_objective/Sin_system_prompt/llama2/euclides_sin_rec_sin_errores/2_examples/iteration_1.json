  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers"

The code you provided is a Python function named `fun_1` that takes two integer arguments, `a` and `b`. The function checks if both arguments are positive integers, and if not, returns a string indicating the error.

If both arguments are valid, the function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number is 0. The remaining number is the GCD.

If the GCD is found, the function returns it. If the loop completes and the smaller number is not 0, the function returns a string indicating that the GCD was not found.

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of a while loop to calculate the GCD is a common and efficient approach. The error handling at the beginning of the function is also a good practice.
