  Sure, here's the analysis of the code:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the index of a target value in a list"

The code defines a function called `fun_1` that takes two arguments, `l` and `t`. The function iterates through the list `l` and finds the index of the target value `t` in the list. If the target value is found, the function returns the index. If the target value is not found, the function returns -1.

Here's the dictionary with the analysis:

{
"code_language": "python",
"code_objective": "define a function that finds the index of a target value in a list"
}
