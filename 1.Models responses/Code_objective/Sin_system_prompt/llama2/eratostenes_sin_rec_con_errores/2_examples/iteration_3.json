  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds all prime numbers up to a given number"

Here's the code with some minor formatting changes:
```
def fun_1(x):
  p = []
  s = [True] * (x + 1)
  s[0] = s[1] = False
  for i in range(2, int(x*0.5) + 1):
    if s[i]:
      p.append(i)
      for j in range(i*i, x + 1, i):
        s[j] = False
  for i in range(int(x*0.5) + 1, x + 1):
    if s[i]:
      p.append(i)
  return p
```
This code defines a function `fun_1` that takes an integer `x` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers up to `x`. The code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime numbers.

The code first initializes a list `p` to store the prime numbers and a list `s` to keep track of whether a number is prime or not. The first two elements of `s` are set to `False` to indicate that 1 and 2 are not prime.

The code then iterates over the numbers from 2 to `x` and checks whether the current number `i` is prime. If `i` is prime, its multiples are marked as non-prime by setting the corresponding elements in `s` to `False`. The prime number `i` is then appended to the `p` list.

Finally, the code returns the `p` list, which contains all the prime numbers up to `x`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
