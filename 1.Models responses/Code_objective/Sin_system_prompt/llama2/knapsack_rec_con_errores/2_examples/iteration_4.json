  {
        code_language: "python",
        code_objective: "define a function that solves a dynamic programming problem",
        }

Explanation:

* The code is written in Python, so the value of "code_language" is "python".
* The code defines a function called "fun_1" that solves a dynamic programming problem, so the value of "code_objective" is "define a function that solves a dynamic programming problem".
