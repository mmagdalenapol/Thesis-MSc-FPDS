        }

Explanation:

* The code is written in Python.
* The objective of the code is to define a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Note:

* The code uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers.
* The function takes two natural number inputs, a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of a and b.
* The function first checks if a and b are natural numbers and ensures that a >= b.
* If b = 0, the function returns a.
* Otherwise, the function calculates the remainder of a/b and makes a recursive call with a = b and b = r.
* The function then returns the result of the recursive call.
* The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers.
