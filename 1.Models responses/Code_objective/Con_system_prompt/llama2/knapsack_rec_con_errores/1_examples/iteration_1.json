  {
        code_language: "python",
        code_objective: "define a function that solves a second order equation",
        }

Explanation:

The code provided is a Python script that defines a function named `solution` that takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function appears to solve a second-order equation of the form `b^2 - 4ac = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The function returns a list of solutions, which are calculated using the formulae `(-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2c)`.

The code also includes a comment that mentions the use of the `math` module, specifically the `sqrt()` function.

Therefore, the dictionary returned by the function contains the following key-value pairs:

* `code_language`: "python" (since the code is written in Python)
* `code_objective`: "define a function that solves a second order equation" (since the code defines a function that solves a second-order equation)
