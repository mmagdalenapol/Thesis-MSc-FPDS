  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the prime numbers up to a given number"

The code you provided is a Python script that defines a function called `fun_1(x)` that finds the prime numbers up to a given number `x`. The function uses a boolean array `s` to keep track of the prime numbers, and a list `p` to store the prime numbers. The function first initializes the boolean array and list, then iterates from 2 to the square root of `x` and marks the prime numbers in the boolean array. It then iterates from the square root of `x` to `x` and marks the prime numbers that have not been marked before. Finally, it returns the list of prime numbers.
