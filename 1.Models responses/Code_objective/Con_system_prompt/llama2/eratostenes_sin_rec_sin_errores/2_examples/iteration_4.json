  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: Python
code_objective: Define a function that finds all prime numbers up to a given number x.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line imports the math module, which provides the sqrt function used in the code.
2. The next line defines a function named solution, which takes three arguments: a, b, and c.
3. The function checks whether b*b - 4*a*c is equal to 0 or not. If it is, the function returns a list containing the solution to the equation.
4. If b*b - 4*a*c is less than 0, the function prints "No solution" and breaks.
5. Otherwise, the function calculates the solutions to the equation using the formula: (-b Â± sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/(2*c)
6. The function returns a list containing the solutions.

Overall, the code defines a function that solves a second-order equation, specifically the quadratic equation. The function takes three arguments, a, b, and c, which are the coefficients of the equation, and returns a list of solutions.
