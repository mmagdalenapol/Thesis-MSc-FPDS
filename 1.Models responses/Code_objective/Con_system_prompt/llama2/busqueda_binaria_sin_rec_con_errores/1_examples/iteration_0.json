  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the index of a target value in a list"

The code you provided is a Python function named `fun_1` that takes two arguments, `l` and `t`. The function iterates through the list `l` and finds the index of the target value `t` in the list. If the target value is found, the function returns the index. If the target value is not found, the function returns -1.

The code uses a while loop to iterate through the list, and it uses the ternary operator to simplify the code. The function also uses the `len` function to get the length of the list, and it uses the `//` operator to perform integer division.

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to read. It is a simple and efficient solution to the problem of finding the index of a target value in a list.
