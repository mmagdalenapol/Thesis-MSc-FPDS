  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds all prime numbers up to a given number"

The code you provided is a Python function named `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `primes`, and `current`. The function is designed to find all prime numbers up to a given number `x`.

The function works by using a recursive approach. It starts by checking if the `primes` argument is None, and if so, it initializes it with a list of numbers from 2 to `x+1`. Then, it checks if the square of the current number `c` is greater than `x`, and if so, it returns the list of primes.

If the square of the current number is not greater than `x`, the function enters a loop that iterates from `c*c` to `x+1` in steps of `c`. For each number `j` in this range, it checks if `j` is in the list of primes, and if so, it removes it from the list.

Finally, the function calls itself recursively with the updated list of primes and the next number `c+1` as the new current number.

Overall, the code you provided is a straightforward implementation of a prime number sieve, and it is written in Python.
