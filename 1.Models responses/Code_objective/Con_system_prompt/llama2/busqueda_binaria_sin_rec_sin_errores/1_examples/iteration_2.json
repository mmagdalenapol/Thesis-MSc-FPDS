  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the index of a target value in a list"

The code you provided is a Python script that defines a function called `fun_1`, which takes two arguments, `l` and `t`. The function finds the index of the target value `t` in the list `l`. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the index, starting from the middle of the list and iteratively narrowing down the search range until the target value is found or the list is empty. The function returns the index of the target value if it exists in the list, or -1 if it doesn't.

Here's the dictionary format of the analysis result:

RESULT:
{
"code_language": "python",
"code_objective": "define a function that finds the index of a target value in a list"
