  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the first c prime numbers greater than c^2"

The code you provided is a Python function named `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`. The function is designed to find the first `c` prime numbers greater than `c^2`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function starts by checking if `p` is None. If it is, it initializes `p` to a list of numbers from 2 to `x+1`.
2. It then checks if `c*c` is greater than `x`. If it is, the function returns `p`.
3. If `c*c` is not greater than `x`, the function enters a loop that iterates from `c*c` to `x+1` in steps of `c`.
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current number `j` is in `p`. If it is, it removes it from `p`.
5. Finally, the function recursively calls itself with `x`, `p`, and `c+1` as arguments.

The objective of the code is to find the first `c` prime numbers greater than `c^2`, which is done by iteratively removing composite numbers from a list of potential prime numbers until the desired number of prime numbers is reached.
