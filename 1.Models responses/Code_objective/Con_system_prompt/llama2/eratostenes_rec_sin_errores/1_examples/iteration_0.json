  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the prime numbers up to a given number"

The code you provided is a Python script that defines a function called `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`. The function is designed to find all prime numbers up to a given number `x`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line `import math` imports the `math` module, which is used to calculate the square root of a number in the function.
2. The function `solution` is defined. It takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function is designed to solve a second-order equation of the form `b^2 - 4ac = 0`.
3. The function first checks if the discriminant `b^2 - 4ac` is equal to zero. If it is, the function returns a list containing the solution(s) of the equation.
4. If the discriminant is not equal to zero, the function checks if it is less than zero. If it is, the function prints "No solution" and breaks out of the function.
5. If the discriminant is greater than or equal to zero, the function calculates the solutions of the equation using the formula `(-b +/-$ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2c)`. The function returns a list containing the solutions.
6. The function `fun_1` is defined. It takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`. The function is designed to find all prime numbers up to a given number `x`.
7. The function first checks if `p` is None. If it is, the function initializes `p` to a list containing the numbers from 2 to `x`.
8. The function then checks if `c*c` is greater than `x`. If it is, the function returns `p`.
9. If `c*c` is less than or equal to `x`, the function iterates over the range `c*c` to `x+1` in steps of `c`. If a number `j` in the range is not in `p`, the function adds it to `p`.
10. Finally, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments `x`, `p`, and `c+1` if `c*c` is less than or equal to `x`.

Overall, the code you provided is a Python script that defines two functions: `solution` and `fun_1`. The `solution` function solves a second-order equation, while the `fun_1` function finds all prime numbers up to a given number.
