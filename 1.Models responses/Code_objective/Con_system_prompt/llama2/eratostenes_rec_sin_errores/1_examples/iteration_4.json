  Sure, here's the analysis of the code you provided:

code_language: "python"
code_objective: "define a function that finds the prime numbers up to a given number"

The code you provided is a Python script that defines a function called `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`. The function is designed to find all prime numbers up to a given number `x`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line `import math` imports the `math` module, which is used to calculate the square root of a number in the function.
2. The function `solution` is defined. It takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function is designed to solve a second-order equation of the form `b^2 - 4ac = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants.
3. The function first checks whether the discriminant `b^2 - 4ac` is equal to zero. If it is, then the function returns a list containing the solution(s) of the equation.
4. If the discriminant is not equal to zero, the function checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero. Depending on the value of the discriminant, the function returns a list containing the solution(s) of the equation or prints "No solution" and breaks out of the function.
5. The function `fun_1` is defined. It takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`. The function is designed to find all prime numbers up to a given number `x`.
6. The function first checks whether `p` is None. If it is, then it initializes `p` to a list containing the numbers from 2 to `x`.
7. The function then checks whether `c*c` is greater than `x`. If it is, then it returns the list `p`.
8. If `c*c` is not greater than `x`, the function iterates over the range `c*c` to `x+1` in steps of `c` and checks whether each number in the range is in the list `p`. If it is, then it removes it from the list.
9. Finally, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments `x`, `p`, and `c+1` to find the prime numbers greater than `c+1`.

Overall, the code you provided is a Python script that defines two functions: `solution` and `fun_1`. The `solution` function solves a second-order equation, while the `fun_1` function finds all prime numbers up to a given number.
