code_sintax_explanation: "There are multiple syntax errors: 
1. The lines starting with '&' are not valid Python syntax, they seem to be intended as comments but should use '#' instead.
2. The line 'a; b == b; a' is not valid, it should be 'a, b = b, a' for swapping values.
3. The function is called 'fun_1' but referenced as 'euclidean_gcd' in the example usage."
