```python

    "code_sintax_error": "Yes",
    "code_sintax_explanation": "There are syntax errors in the code. Specifically, the lines starting with '&' are not valid Python syntax. These lines seem to be intended as comments, but in Python, comments are denoted by '#' instead of '&'. Additionally, there's a missing function call for 'fun_1' which is referenced in the example usage as 'euclidean_gcd'."
