    code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. First, the variable 'p' is not defined before it is used in the if statement. Second, the range function requires two arguments, but it is called with three arguments in the for loop. Third, the variable 'c' is not defined before it is used in the for loop. Finally, the function 'fun_1' is missing a closing bracket '}'."
