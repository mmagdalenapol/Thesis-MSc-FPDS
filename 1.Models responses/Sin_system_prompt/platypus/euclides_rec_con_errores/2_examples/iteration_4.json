    code_sintax_explanation: "The code contains several syntax errors. Here are the details:

1. The '&' symbol is not valid in Python syntax.
2. The 'Verify that a and b are natural numbers' and 'Ensure that a >= b' comments are not properly formatted.
3. The 'a; b == b; a' line is not valid Python code.
4. The 'if b == 0' block is not properly indented.
5. The 'return fun_1(b, r)' line is missing parentheses around the function call.

Please correct these errors before running the code."
