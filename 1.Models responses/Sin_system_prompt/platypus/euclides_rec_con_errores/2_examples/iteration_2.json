    code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. First, the ampersand (&) symbol is not valid in Python code. Second, the comments starting with '&' are not valid Python comments. Third, the assignment statements like 'a; b == b; a' are not valid Python syntax. Fourth, the 'return' statement is missing a colon (:) after it. Fifth, the 'if' statements are missing colons after them. Sixth, the '==' operator is used for comparison, not assignment. Seventh, the 'print' statement is missing parentheses around the arguments. Eighth, the 'euclidean_gcd' function is not defined."
