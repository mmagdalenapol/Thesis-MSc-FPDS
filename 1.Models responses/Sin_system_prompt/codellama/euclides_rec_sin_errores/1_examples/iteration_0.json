The code has a syntax error in the line 'if b*b-4*a*c =0:'. The correct syntax for comparison is 'if b*b-4*a*c == 0:'. The '=' operator is used for assignment, while the '==' operator is used for comparison.

Here is the corrected code:

```
import math
def solution(a, b, c):
    if b*b-4*a*c == 0:
        solution = [-b/(2*c),]
    if b*b-4*a*c <0:
        print("No solution")
        break
    else:
        solution = [(-b+math. sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c),(-b-math. sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c)]

    return solution
```

The corrected code should now run without any syntax errors.
