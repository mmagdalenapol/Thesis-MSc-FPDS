code_sintax_explanation: "There are multiple syntax errors in the code. 1) The function definition 'def fun_1(l, t)' is missing a colon at the end. 2) The assignment 'x; y = 0; len(l) - 1' is not valid, it should be two separate assignments. 3) The variable 'd' is not defined, it should be 'D'. 4) The if-elif-else statements are missing colons at the end of each condition."
