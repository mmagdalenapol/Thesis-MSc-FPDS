code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. 1) The function definition is missing a colon at the end. 2) The assignment of x and y is not correct, it should be two separate lines or use a tuple assignment. 3) The variable 'd' is not defined, it should be 'D'. 4) The if and elif statements are missing a colon at the end."
