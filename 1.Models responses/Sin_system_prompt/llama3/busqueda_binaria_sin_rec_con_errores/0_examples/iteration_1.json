Here is the result:

{
"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. 1) The function definition is missing a colon at the end. It should be 'def fun_1(l, t):' instead of 'def fun_1(l, t)'. 2) The variables x and y are not assigned correctly. It should be 'x, y = 0, len(l) - 1' instead of 'x; y = 0; len(l) - 1'. 3) The variable 'd' is not defined. It should be 'D' instead of 'd' in the if and elif conditions. 4) The indentation is not consistent. It should be consistent throughout the code."
