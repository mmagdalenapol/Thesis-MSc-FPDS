code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors. The comments should start with '#' instead of '&'. The assignment operator is '=' but it's used as '==' in 'a; b == b; a'. The function name in the function call is 'euclidean_gcd' but it's defined as 'fun_1'. The correct way to swap values is 'a, b = b, a'."
