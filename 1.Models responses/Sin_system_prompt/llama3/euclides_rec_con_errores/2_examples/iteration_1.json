code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. The comments should start with '#' instead of '&'. The assignment operator is '=' but it is used as '==' in the line 'a; b == b; a'. The function name in the function definition is 'fun_1' but it is called as 'euclidean_gcd' in the example usage."
