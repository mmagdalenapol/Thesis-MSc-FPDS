Here is the result:

{
"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. 
1. The lines '& Verify that a and b are natural numbers', '& Ensure that a >= b', '& Base case: if b = 0, a is the output', '& Find the remainder of a/b', '& Recursive call with a = b and b = r', and '& Example usage' are not valid Python syntax. 
2. The line 'if b > a: a; b == b; a' is not a valid Python statement. It seems like the intention was to swap the values of a and b, but the correct syntax would be 'a, b = b, a'. 
3. The function name in the function definition is 'fun_1' but it is called as 'euclidean_gcd' in the example usage. The function name should be consistent."
