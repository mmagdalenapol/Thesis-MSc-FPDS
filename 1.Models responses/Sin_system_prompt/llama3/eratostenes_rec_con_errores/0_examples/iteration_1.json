Here is the result:

{
"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. 
1. In the line `if p is None:`, `p` is not defined. It should be `primes`. 
2. In the line `p = [i for i in range[2, x + 1]]`, `range` is a function and should be called with parentheses, not brackets. It should be `range(2, x + 1)`. 
3. In the line `for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]:`, `range` is a function and should be called with parentheses, not brackets. It should be `range(c*c, x+1, c)`. 
4. The variable `c` is not defined. It should be `current`. 
5. The function call `return fun_1(x, c + 1, p)` is recursive, but the base case is not properly defined. The function will keep calling itself until it reaches the maximum recursion depth, causing a runtime error."
