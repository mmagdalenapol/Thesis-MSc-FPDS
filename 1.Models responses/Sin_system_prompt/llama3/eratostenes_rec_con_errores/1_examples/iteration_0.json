code_sintax_explanation: "There are multiple syntax errors. In 'if p is None:', 'p' is not defined, it should be 'primes'. In 'p = [i for i in range[2, x + 1]]', 'range' is a function and should be called with parentheses, not brackets. In 'for j in range [c*c,  x+1, c]:', 'range' is a function and should be called with parentheses, not brackets."
