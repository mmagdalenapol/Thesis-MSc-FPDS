code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, the ampersand (&) symbol is not valid in Python and should be removed. Additionally, there are several instances of unnecessary semicolons (;) in the code, which are not needed in Python. Furthermore, the function name 'fun_1' is not defined. Finally, the last line of the code, 'print("GCD of", a, "and", b, "is", euclidean_gcd(a, b))', is not indented and would throw a SyntaxError if run."
