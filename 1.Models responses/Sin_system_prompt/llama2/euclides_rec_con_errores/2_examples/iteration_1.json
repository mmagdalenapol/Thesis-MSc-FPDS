code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, the ampersand (&) symbol is not valid in Python and should be removed. Additionally, there are several instances of unnecessary semicolons (;) in the code, which are not needed in Python. Furthermore, the function name 'fun_1' is not defined. Finally, the last line of the code, 'print("GCD of", a, "and", b, "is", euclidean_gcd(a, b))', is not indented and would throw a syntax error.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

def fun_1(a, b):
    if a < 0 or b < 0:
        raise ValueError("Inputs must be natural numbers")
    if b > a:
        a, b = b, a
    if b == 0:
        return a
    r = a % b
    return fun_1(b, r)

example_usage = """
a = 10
b = 6
print("GCD of", a, "and", b, "is", fun_1(a, b))
"""

Note that I've also removed the unnecessary '&' symbols and semicolons, and corrected the function name to 'fun_1' instead of 'euclidean_gcd'."
