code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "In 'b*b-4*a*c =0' the sintaxis for comparison is not correct."
}

The code has a syntax error in the line 'b*b-4*a*c =0'. The comparison operator '=' should be replaced with '==' to test for equality. The corrected line would be 'b*b-4*a*c == 0'.

Additionally, the function 'fun_1' has a logical error. The base case 'if b == 0' is not properly handled. The function will raise a 'ZeroDivisionError' when trying to divide by zero. The corrected version would be:

def fun_1(a, b):
    & Verify that a and b are natural numbers
    if a < 0 or b < 0:
        raise ValueError("Inputs must be natural numbers")
    & Ensure that a >= b
    if b > a:
        a, b = b, a
        & Base case: if b = 0, a is the output
    if b == 0:
        return a
    & Find the remainder of a/b
    r = a % b
    & Recursive call with a = b and b = r
    return fun_1(b, r)

The function 'euclidean_gcd' is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it cannot be analyzed for syntax errors.
