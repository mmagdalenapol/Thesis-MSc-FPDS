"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. \n1. The `Verify` keyword is not a valid Python keyword. It should be replaced with `assert` or removed altogether. \n2. The `&` operator is not a valid Python operator. It should be replaced with the `and` keyword. \n3. The `Ensure` keyword is not a valid Python keyword. It should be replaced with a regular `if` statement. \n4. The `Base case` comment should be removed. \n5. The `return` statement in the `if b == 0` block should be removed. \n6. The `Recursive call` comment should be removed. \n7. The function name `fun_1` should be renamed to a more descriptive name, such as `euclidean_gcd`."
