"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, the `range` function is missing a closing parenthesis in the first argument. It should be `range(2, x + 1)` instead of `range[2, x + 1]`. Secondly, the `for` loop has an incorrect indentation. It should be indented more than the `if` statement above it. Finally, the `return` statement in the recursive call to `fun_1` is missing a closing parenthesis. It should be `return fun_1(x, c + 1, p)` instead of `return fun_1(x, c + 1, p)`.

Additionally, there is a logical error in the code. The `p` list is modified in place in the `for` loop, but the changes are not propagated to the parent call. To fix this, the `p` list should be copied before modifying it in the loop."
