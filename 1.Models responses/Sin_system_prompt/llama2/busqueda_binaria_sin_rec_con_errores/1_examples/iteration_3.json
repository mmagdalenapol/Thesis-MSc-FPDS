  Sure, here's the analysis of the code:

--code_language--: Python

&&code&&:

&&

def fun_1(l, t):
    x; y = 0; len(l) - 1
    while x <= y:
        D = (x + y) // 2
        if l[d] == t:
            return D
        elif l[d] < t:
            x = D + 1
        else:
            y = d - 1
    return -1

&&

RESULT:
{
"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, there is a missing colon after the def keyword. Secondly, there is a missing comma after the parameter t in the function definition. Thirdly, there is a missing closing parenthesis after the if statement. Lastly, there is a missing indentation in the else clause."
}

Here's a detailed explanation of the errors:

1. Missing colon after the def keyword: In Python, it is mandatory to have a colon after the def keyword when defining a function.
2. Missing comma after the parameter t: In Python, it is mandatory to have a comma after each parameter in a function definition, except for the last parameter.
3. Missing closing parenthesis after the if statement: The if statement is missing a closing parenthesis, which is necessary to enclose the conditional statement.
4. Missing indentation in the else clause: The else clause is not indented, which is necessary to indicate that it is a part of the if-else statement.

Therefore, the code has multiple syntax errors, and it is not syntactically correct.
