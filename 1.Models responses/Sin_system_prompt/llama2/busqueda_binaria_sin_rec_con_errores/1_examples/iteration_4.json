  Sure, here's the analysis of the code:

{
code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code.

1. In 'def fun_1(l, t)', the parameter 't' is not defined.
2. In 'x; y = 0; len(l) - 1', there are multiple assignments in a single line, which is not allowed in Python.
3. In 'while x <= y', the comparison operator should be '≤' instead of '<='.
4. In 'if l[d] == t:', the index 'd' is not defined.
5. In 'elif l[d] < t', the comparison operator should be ' '<' instead of '≤'.
6. In 'else', the 'y = d - 1' statement is not indented, so it will be executed regardless of the condition.
7. In 'return -1', there is no return statement in the function, so this will raise a SyntaxError.

The code has too many syntax errors, so it's not possible to provide a detailed explanation of each one. The errors listed above are the most obvious ones, but there could be more."
