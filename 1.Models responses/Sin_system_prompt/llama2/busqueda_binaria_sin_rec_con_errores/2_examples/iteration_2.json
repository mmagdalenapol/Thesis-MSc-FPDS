code_sintax_explanation: "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, the function name 'fun_1' is not properly defined, it should be 'def fun_1(l, t):' instead of 'def fun_1(l, t):'. Secondly, the variable 'x' and 'y' are not defined. Thirdly, the while loop is not properly defined, it should be 'while x <= y:' instead of 'while x <= y'. Lastly, the return statement should be indented."
