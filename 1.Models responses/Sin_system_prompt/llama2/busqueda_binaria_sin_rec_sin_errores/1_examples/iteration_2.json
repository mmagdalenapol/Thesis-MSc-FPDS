  Sure, here's the analysis of the code:

{
code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "In 'b*b-4*a*c =0' the syntax for comparison is not correct. The correct syntax would be 'b*b - 4*a*c == 0'."
}

The error in the code is the use of a single '=' instead of the double '==' for comparison. This is a common syntax error in Python.
