  Sure, here's the analysis of the code:

{
code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "In 'b*b-4*a*c =0' the syntax for comparison is not correct. The comparison operator should be '==' instead of '='."
}

The code has a syntax error in the line 'b*b-4*a*c =0'. The comparison operator '=' should be replaced with '==' to check for equality. The correct line should be 'b*b-4*a*c == 0'.

Additionally, the function 'solution' is defined inside the conditionals, which means it will only be defined if the condition inside the if/else statement is true. This might not be the intended behavior. It's better to define the function outside of the conditionals and then call it inside the if/else statement.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

import math

def solution(a, b, c):
    if b*b-4*a*c == 0:
        return [-b/(2*c),]
    elif b*b-4*a*c < 0:
        print("No solution")
        break
    else:
        return [(-b+math.sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c),(-b-math.sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c)]

a = input("Enter the value of a: ")
b = input("Enter the value of b: ")
c = input("Enter the value of c: ")

solution(a, b, c)
