The code does not have any syntax errors.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code defines a function called `fun_1` that takes two arguments, `l` and `t`.
2. The function calculates the midpoint of the list `l` using the formula `(x + y) // 2`.
3. It then checks if the element at the midpoint is equal to `t`. If it is, it returns the index of the element.
4. If the element at the midpoint is not equal to `t`, it checks if the element is less than `t`. If it is, it sets `x` to the index of the midpoint plus 1. Otherwise, it sets `y` to the index of the midpoint minus 1.
5. It then repeats steps 3-4 until it finds the element `t` or reaches the end of the list.
6. If it doesn't find the element `t`, it returns -1.

The code is written in Python, and there are no syntax errors. Therefore, the answer to the question "Is there any syntax error in the code?" is "No".
