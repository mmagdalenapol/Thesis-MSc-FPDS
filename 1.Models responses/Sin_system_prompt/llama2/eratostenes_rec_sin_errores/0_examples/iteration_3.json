"code_sintax_error": "Yes",
"code_sintax_explanation": "There are several syntax errors in the code. Firstly, the `if` statement in the third line is missing a colon after the condition. Secondly, the `for` loop in the fifth line has a missing colon after the loop header. Finally, the recursive call to `fun_1` in the last line is missing a comma after the argument `c + 1`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```
def fun_1(x, p=None, c=2):
    if p is None:
        p = [i for i in range(2, x + 1)]
    if c * c > x:
        return p
    for j in range(c * c, x + 1, c):
        if j in p:
            p.remove(j)
    return fun_1(x, p, c + 1),
```
The corrected code should now work as intended."
