The code does not have any syntax errors.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code defines a function `fun_1` that takes three arguments: `x`, `p`, and `c`.
2. The function checks if `p` is None, and if so, it sets `p` to a list of numbers from 2 to `x + 1`.
3. The function then checks if `c * c` is greater than `x`. If it is, the function returns `p`.
4. If `c * c` is not greater than `x`, the function iterates over a range of numbers from `c * c` to `x + 1` in steps of `c`. For each number in the range, it checks if the number is in `p`. If it is, the number is removed from `p`.
5. Finally, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments `x`, `p`, and `c + 1`.

The code does not have any syntax errors, and it appears to be well-formed. Therefore, the answer to the question "Is there any syntax error in the code?" is "No".
