  {
        code_sintax_error: "Yes",
        code_sintax_explanation: "In 'c * c > x' the sintaxis for comparison is not correct. Also, in 'return fun_1(x, p, c + 1)' there is a missing parentheses."
        }

The errors in the code are:

* In the line 'b*b-4*a*c =0', the syntax for comparison is not correct. It should be 'b*b - 4*a*c == 0'
* In the line 'c * c > x', the syntax for comparison is not correct. It should be 'c**2 > x'
* In the line 'return fun_1(x, p, c + 1)', there is a missing parentheses. It should be 'return fun_1(x, p, c+1)'

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
