        code_sintax_error: "Yes",
        code_sintax_explanation: "In 'c * c > x' the sintaxis for comparison is not correct."
        }

The error in the code is the use of the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (==) in the conditionals.

In the first code snippet, the condition `b*b-4*a*c =0` should be `b*b-4*a*c == 0` to check if the expression is equal to zero.

In the second code snippet, the condition `c * c > x` should be `c * c >= x` to check if the expression is greater than or equal to x.
