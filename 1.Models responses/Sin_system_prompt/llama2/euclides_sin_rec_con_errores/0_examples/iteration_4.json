The code does not have any syntax errors.

It's worth noting that the code has a logical error. The while loop in the function `fun_1` will run indefinitely if the input values `a` and `b` are both zero or both negative, because the condition `y != 0` will always be true in that case. This will cause the function to never return a value.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are both positive and have a common factor greater than 1. For example, if `a` is 6 and `b` is 3, the function will return "No se encontr√≥" instead of 2, which is the greatest common divisor of 6 and 3.

It's important to note that this analysis is based on the code provided and may not be exhaustive. There could be other errors or edge cases that are not caught by this analysis.
