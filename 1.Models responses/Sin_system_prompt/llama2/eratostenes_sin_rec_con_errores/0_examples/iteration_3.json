The code does not have any syntax errors, and it is valid Python code.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code defines a function `fun_1(x)` that takes a single argument `x`.
2. It initializes two lists: `p` and `s`. `p` is an empty list that will store the values of `i` for which `s[i]` is `True`, and `s` is a list of `x + 1` Boolean values, with the first two elements set to `False`.
3. The code then iterates over the range `range(2, int(x*0.5) + 1)` and checks if `s[i]` is `True`. If it is, then it appends `i` to the `p` list and sets `s[j]` to `False` for all `j` in the range `range(i*i, x + 1, i)`.
4. Finally, the code iterates over the range `range(int(x*0.5) + 1, x + 1)` and checks if `s[i]` is `True`. If it is, then it appends `i` to the `p` list.
5. The function returns the `p` list.

The code seems to be implementing a algorithm to find certain values in a range that satisfy a certain condition. The condition is that the value of `s[i]` is `True` for some `i` in the range `range(2, x + 1)`. The function returns a list of all such values.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
