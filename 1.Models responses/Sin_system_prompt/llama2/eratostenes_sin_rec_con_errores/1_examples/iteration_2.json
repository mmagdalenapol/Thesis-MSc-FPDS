code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "In 'b*b-4*a*c =0' the syntax for comparison is not correct."
}

The error in the code is the use of a single "=" instead of a double "==" for the comparison in the if statement. In Python, a single "=" is used for assignment, while a double "==" is used for comparison.

The corrected code would be:

if b*b-4*a*c == 0:
    solution = [-b/(2*c),]
if b*b-4*a*c < 0:
    print("No solution")
    break
else:
    solution = [(-b+math.sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c),(-b-math.sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c)]

return solution

It's also worth noting that the break statement is not necessary in the else clause, as the return statement will exit the function regardless.
