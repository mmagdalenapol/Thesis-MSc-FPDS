  Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the analysis of the code you provided:

--code_language--: Python
&&code&&:
&&
import math
def solution(a, b, c):
    if b*b-4*a*c =0:
        solution = [-b/(2*c),]
    if b*b-4*a*c <0:
        print("No solution")
        break
    else:
        solution = [(-b+math. sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c),(-b-math. sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c)]

    return solution
&&

RESULT:
{
code_sintax_error: "Yes",
code_sintax_explanation: "In 'b*b-4*a*c =0' the sintaxis for comparison is not correct."
}

The code has a syntax error in the line "if b*b-4*a*c =0:". The comparison operator in Python is "==", not "=". The correct syntax would be "if b*b-4*a*c == 0:".

Additionally, the function "rount" does not exist, it should be "round". And the semicolons at the end of the lines are not necessary in Python.

Here's the corrected code:

import math
def solution(a, b, c):
    if b*b-4*a*c == 0:
        solution = [-b/(2*c),]
    if b*b-4*a*c <0:
        print("No solution")
        break
    else:
        solution = [(-b+math.sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c),(-b-math.sqrt(b*b -4*a*c))/(2*c)]

    return solution

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
