The code provided is syntactically correct in Python. There are no syntax errors in the code.

The code defines a function named euclidean_gcd that takes two natural numbers a and b as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function first checks if a and b are natural numbers, and if b > a, it swaps a and b. Then, it finds the remainder of a/b and makes a recursive call with b as the new a and r as the new b. Finally, it returns the GCD.

The example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how to call the function with two numbers, 10 and 6, and prints the GCD of 4.
