The code is written in Python.

The code has a syntax error. The function `fun_1` is calling itself recursively with the arguments in a different order than they are defined in the function definition. The correct order should be `fun_1(W - Wt[n - 1], Wt, val, n - 1)` and `fun_1(W, Wt, val, n - 1)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def fun_1(W, wt, val, n):
    if n == 0 or W == 0:
        return 0, []
    if wt[n - 1] > W:
        return fun_1(W, wt, val, n - 1)
    else:
        v_i, i_i = fun_1(W - wt[n - 1], wt, val, n - 1)
        v_n_i, i_n_i = fun_1(W, wt, val, n - 1)
        if v_i + val[n - 1] > v_n_i:
            return v_i + val[n - 1], i_i + [n]
        else:
            return v_n_i, i_n_i
```

The dictionary with the results is:

```python
{
    "code_sintax_error": "Yes",
    "code_sintax_explanation": "The function 'fun_1' is calling itself recursively with the arguments in a different order than they are defined in the function definition. The correct order should be 'fun_1(W - Wt[n - 1], Wt, val, n - 1)' and 'fun_1(W, Wt, val, n - 1)'."
}
