"code_sintax_explanation": "In the function 'fun_1', the syntax for defining a function is incorrect. The correct syntax is 'def function_name(parameters):'. In this case, the function should be defined as 'def fun_1(l, t):'. Also, the variable 'D' is not defined before it is used. The correct syntax is 'D = (x + y) // 2'. The variable 'd' is not defined, it should be 'D'. The variable 'len(l) - 1' is not used anywhere in the function. The correct syntax is 'y = len(l) - 1'. The 'while' loop condition is incorrect. The correct syntax is 'while x <= y'. The 'return' statement is not indented correctly. The correct syntax is 'return -1'. The 'elif' statement is incorrect. The correct syntax is 'elif l[D] < t:'. The 'else' statement is incorrect. The correct syntax is 'else:'. The 'return' statement is not indented correctly. The correct syntax is 'return D'."
