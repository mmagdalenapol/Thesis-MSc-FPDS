The code has a syntax error. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def fun_1(l, t):
    x, y = 0, len(l) - 1
    while x <= y:
        D = (x + y) // 2
        if l[D] == t:
            return D
        elif l[D] < t:
            x = D + 1
        else:
            y = D - 1
    return -1
```

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
{
    "code_sintax_error": "Yes",
    "code_sintax_explanation": "The function definition is missing a colon at the end. Also, the variable 'd' is not defined in the code. It should be 'D' instead. The variable 'x' is not being incremented or decremented in the while loop. The variable 'y' is being decremented by 'd' instead of 'D'. The return statement is not indented correctly."
}
```
