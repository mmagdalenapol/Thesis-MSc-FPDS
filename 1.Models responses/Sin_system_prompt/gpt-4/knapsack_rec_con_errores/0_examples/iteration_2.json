    "code_sintax_explanation": "There are multiple syntax errors in the provided Python code: 1. The variable 'Wt' is used, but it is not defined or passed as an argument. This will cause a NameError. It likely should be 'wt', matching the argument name. 2. The recursive call 'fun_1(W - Wt[n - 1], wt, n - 1, val)' is incorrectly structured. The fourth argument should be 'n - 1' instead of 'val', and 'val' should be the third argument. Corrected, it should be 'fun_1(W - wt[n - 1], wt, val, n - 1)'. 3. In the expression 'fun_1(W, Wt, - 1, val)', 'Wt' again appears to be incorrectly used (should be 'wt') and '- 1' appears to be meant as an index (n - 1) but is incorrectly placed, breaking the syntax. It should be 'fun_1(W, wt, val, n - 1)'."
