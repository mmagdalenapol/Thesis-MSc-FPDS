  "code_sintax_explanation": "The code contains multiple syntax errors: 1. 'p is None' should be 'primes is None' as 'p' is not defined. 2. 'range[2, x + 1]' should be 'range(2, x + 1)' because 'range' is a function, not an array. 3. 'if c * c > x:' should refer to 'current * current > x:' as 'c' is not defined. 4. 'range [c*c,  x+1, c]' should be corrected to 'range(current*current, x+1, current)' as 'range' is a function and 'c' is undefined. 5. Recursive call 'fun_1(x, c + 1, p)' should be 'fun_1(x, primes, current + 1)' using appropriate variable names."
