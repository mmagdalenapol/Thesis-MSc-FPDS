    "code_sintax_explanation": "Several syntax errors are present: Comments should be denoted by '#' instead of '&'. Also, the assignment 'a; b == b; a' is not valid and seems to attempt to swap 'a' and 'b', which should be done as 'a, b = b, a'. Additionally, the use of '==' in 'a == 10' and 'b == 6' is incorrect for variable assignment, it should use '='. Furthermore, 'euclidean_gcd(a, b)' should be 'fun_1(a, b)' to match the function's definition."
