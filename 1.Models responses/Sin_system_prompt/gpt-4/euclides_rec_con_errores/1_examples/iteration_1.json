    "code_sintax_explanation": "Several syntax issues exist: \n1. Single ampersand (&) is used for commenting, which is incorrect as '#' is used for comments in Python. \n2. 'a; b == b; a' intends to swap values but is incorrect; should be 'a, b = b, a'. \n3. 'a == 10' and 'b == 6' uses comparison operators instead of assignment, should be 'a = 10' and 'b = 6'. \n4. Function call 'euclidean_gcd(a, b)' is incorrect because the defined function is 'fun_1'."
