    "code_sintax_explanation": "Several syntax issues exist in the code: 1. Python does not support comments starting with '&'. Use '#' for comments. 2. In the line 'a; b == b; a', the syntax is incorrect. It appears the intent was to swap the values of 'a' and 'b', which should be written as 'a, b = b, a'. 3. 'euclidean_gcd(a, b)' is called in the print statement, but no function named 'euclidean_gcd' is defined; it seems it should be 'fun_1(a, b)'. 4. Assignment 'a == 10' and 'b == 6' use '==' (comparison operator) instead of '=' (assignment operator)."
