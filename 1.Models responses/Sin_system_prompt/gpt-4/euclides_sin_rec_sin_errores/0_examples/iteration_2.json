    "code_sintax_explanation": "In the provided Python code, there is a logical error related to how the variables 'x' and 'y' are updated in the while loop. The line 'y = c' should be 'y = r' to correctly implement the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). This algorithm requires replacing the smaller number by the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller one until the remainder is zero."
