Here is a Python code that implements the steps you described:

```python
import math

def sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):
    x = [True for i in range(n+1)]
    x[0] = x[1] = False
    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n)+1):
        if x[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                x[j] = False
    return [i for i in range(n+1) if x[i]]

n = 30
print(sieve_of_eratosthenes(n))
```

This code first initializes an array `x` of size `n+1` with all values set to `True`. Then it sets the first two elements to `False`. After that, it iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `x[i]` is `True`, it changes the values of `x` to `False` at positions `j*j` through `n` by jumping from `j` to `j`. Finally, it returns the indices of `x` that take the value `True`.

The `math.isqrt(n)` function is used to get the nearest integer to the square root of `n`.

The `range(i*i, n+1, i)` expression generates a sequence of numbers from `i*i` to `n`, jumping from `j` to `j`.

The `[i for i in range(n+1) if x[i]]` expression is a list comprehension that generates a list of indices `i` for which `x[i]` is `True`.

You can change the value of `n` to any natural number to test the code.
